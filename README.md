## Instagram-app


This is more like an instagram app instance that only displays the recent photos of the user using instagram's API.



## Setup


To use the instagram API,
we have to get an access token that allows our app to retrieve data related to our Instagram account.
An access token, as the name goes,
is a string-based token that Instagram uses to authenticate a user trying to access an API endpoint.
The instagram-node SDK is capable of exchanging a client_id as well,
if you register your app with Instagram,
so just use a third-party service, PixelUnion (http://instagram.pixelunion.net/) to get the access token.
